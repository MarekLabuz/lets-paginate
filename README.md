**What does it do?**
It provides a set of tools so that you wouldn't bother about paginating and caching you data in a react/redux application.

**How does it work?**
It just stores your cached data in a redux store in chunks, so it can be easily accessed.

**How can I make it work?**

First step: You need to import a reducer included in a package and add it to your main reducer:

```js
import { reducer } from 'lets-paginate'
// ...
const reducers = {
  // ...
  pagination: reducer
}
// ...
combineReducers(reducers)
```

Second step: Import ```reduxPagination``` wrapper and attach it to your component. There are two configuration option you have to provide: ```name``` is an unique name for your data, ```fetch``` is a function where you fetch new data from an external source.

```js
import { reduxPagination } from 'lets-paginate'
// ...
export default reduxPagination({
  name: 'users',
  fetch: getUsers
})(Users)
```

Third step: Implement function ```fetch```. Example below:

```js
export const getUsers ({ page, entries }) => dispatch =>
  API.users.get({ page, entries })
    .then(response => response.data)
    .catch(() => [])
```

What's crucial is that you have to return a Promise with new data to be stored in redux state

Fourth step: Enjoy! Below I've desribed all awesome things that you can do with lets-paginate ;)

**API reference:**

When you wrap your React component with ```reduxPagination``` (like the example above), you will gain a few new props:
- ```data``` is a prop that contains a piece of your cached data basing on values of ```page``` and ```entries```. It takes a  value of undefined when new data is being fetched.
- ```page``` is a current page
- ```entries``` is a number of items on a current page
- ```onPageChange({ page, entries } [, params])``` is a function that sets new values of ```page``` and ```entries``` and updates ```data```. When no data is available with a new values of ```page``` and ```entries``` it automatically dispatches function ```fetch``` (provided in ```reduxPagination```)
- ```onAddItem(item [, index])``` is a fuction that adds a new element to your cached data at ```index```. Default value of ```index``` is 0. ```onAddItem``` with a value of index equal to -1 adds the item after the last element of cached data.
- ```onRemoveItem(index)``` is a function that removes element at ```index```
- ```reset()``` is a function that deletes all cached data
